# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application structured with separate directories for JavaScript (`js`), CSS (`css`), and images (`img`). The entry point of the application is the `index.html` file located at the project root. The project is intended for hosting on any static file server.

## Technical Highlights

### Project Structure

- **Modular File Organization**: The source files are separated into distinct folders for scripts, styles, and images to improve maintainability, scalability, and ease of asset management.
- **Entry Point**: The application starts from `index.html`, which loads all necessary client scripts and assets.

### Asset Loading

- Asset referencing in HTML is relative, ensuring compatibility across different hosting environments and ease of deployment without path-related issues.
- The project avoids hardcoded URLs for assets, facilitating quick porting between environments (local, staging, production).

### JavaScript & CSS Practices

- JavaScript and CSS are fully decoupled, supporting independent bundling and minimization.

### Performance & Compatibility

- Designed to minimize render-blocking resources by recommending all scripts be loaded at the end of the HTML body or using the `defer` attribute.
- Style sheets are loaded in the `<head>` to ensure proper rendering flow without flash-of-unstyled-content (FOUC).
- Asset folders facilitate CDN-based or cache busting strategies without code refactoring.

### Development & Expansion

- **Extensibility**: The modular folder structure allows for adding new features or sections simply by expanding the associated directory (e.g., add new JS modules in `js/`).
- **Third-party Libraries**: The structure allows including additional JS/CSS libraries by placing them directly within the corresponding folders or referencing from package managers/CDNs.

### IDE Support

- Includes an `.idea` directory, suggesting optimized compatibility and settings for JetBrains IDEs (e.g., WebStorm).
- Project layout and configuration files are friendly to code linting, formatting, and refactoring tools.

## Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository** and serve the project on any local server
2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser; the app is ready to use.

## Customization & Notes

- The project is designed to be stateless and easy to deploy on any platform that serves static files.
- Updates can be applied simply by replacing or modifying files in the relevant directories.
